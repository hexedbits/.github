# Support

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: Read the documentation and guides for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. These should be located in a root `docs/` directory. If there is an example project, explore that to learn how it works.

1. :bulb: Ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). This is usually the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

1. :memo: If you do not succeed with either of those, please open an issue on GitHub to ask for help. Please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem.

## Things NOT to do 

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. :x: Do not reach out to the author on Twitter (or other social media) by tweeting or sending a direct message.

1. :x: Do not email the author.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. ✌️
